# infer_caffe

This version aiming at inference using pure C++, modified from [mini-caffe](https://github.com/luoyetx/mini-caffe/). Thanks for the author's work. The **mini-caffe** has some errors on Ubuntu. We made some fix on that. 

Hands on quickly:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j32
```



# Examples

Original provide some examples, which is useful, and we enhanced that. A **Pure C++ RFCN** model can be inference on video. Check out the result!
